# KAFKA POC

## Preface

This is mainly to play around with Apache Kafka and learn how to use it. Eventually, the end goal would be to build confidence on using Apache Kafka and introduce it to the company as our main messaging queue.

However, I feel that playing around will lead me nowhere and thus the need to create this repository. Here I will list out all the things I need to do to achieve my goal.

## TODO

- [ ] Create a simple producer and subscriber that can introduce the basic commands and terms of apache kafka
- [ ] Create a real life producer and subscriber for nodejs
- [ ] Create a write-up on how to debug apache kafka messages
- [ ] Create an application that will emulate syncing (multiple nodejs application)
- [ ] Write a test to compare MQTT with Apache KAFKA bases on performance
- [ ] Stress test Apache KAFKA
